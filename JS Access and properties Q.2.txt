var obj1 = { which : "obj1" },
obj2 = { which : "obj2" };

function execute(arg1, arg2){
    console.log(this.which, arg1, arg2);
}

//using call
execute.call(obj1, "dan", "stanhope");
//output: obj1 dan stanhope

//using apply
execute.apply(obj2, ["dan", "stanhope"]);
//output: obj2 dan stanhope

//using old school
execute("dan", "stanhope");


What is the difference between call and apply functions?


The difference is that call() takes the function arguments separately, and apply() takes the function arguments in an array. CALL : A function with argument provide individually. If you know the arguments to be passed or there are no argument to pass you can use call.
